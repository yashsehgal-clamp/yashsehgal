Well, It's been a great experience working as a Frontend SDE Intern at economize.cloud. First of all, A special thanks to all my collegues to helping me out at every point, with every tasks. They were there to help me, and the culture here is amazing ðŸ”¥

A Great thanks to [Anirudh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manirudh/) for giving me this opportunity to work with a wonderful team.

## How it all started

In my initial sophomore year, I was looking for some frontend development intern roles and applied to a bunch of startups. Economize was one of them, the day I applied, immediately I got a response, stating that they're interested in my profile for the same role.

I and Anirudh had our first Google Meet, and we discussed about each and everything, from UI development to Design Systems. The interview experience was great and very supportive.
After some days, they decided to have me onboard.
And I was so happy at that time, as it's my first ever developer internship.

I joined them, the onbaording was very great. I was for the first time looking at a company's codebase.

## Things I worked on during this role

Their frontend technology-stack is on VueJS, SCSS and backend is on GoLang. Before this internship, I had a very little experience with VueJS, although I was/am still good in SCSS.
